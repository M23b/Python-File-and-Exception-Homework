# Python-File-and-Exception-Homework
Create a program that manages a to do list.  The program should support creating a new list, appending to an existing list, and printing out the current list.  There should be exception handling when the program tries to read a file and it does not exist. When you run the program it should ask the user to Enter 1 if they want to create a list, 2 if they want to append to a current list, and 3 if they want to print the current list.        If they want to create the list you will need to ask for the file name to create and the number of items to add to the list.  Then ask the user to enter those items. When the items are added the full list should be printed out.     If they want to append to a current list you will need to ask the name of the file containing the ilst and the number of items to append.  Then ask the user to enter those items. When the items are added the full list should be printed out.     If they want to print the list you will need to ask them for the file name of the list and print out those items.      You should use functions where appropriate to improve readability, reliability, and reusability.  Programs that do not have functions to break up the work will be marked down heavily, even if they work!
